# weather-trend
A problem set from the code clinic series on depicting a trend on the weather data collection.

This task involves calculating statistics from a data-set. We shall start with the weather data captured from lake Pond Oreille in Northern Idaho, US.

We have almost 20 Mb of data from the years 2012-15 containing several variables or properties. Our aim for this task is to write a function that accepts a start date and time and an end date and time and inclusive of those dates and times return the coefficient of the slope of the barometric pressure.

A rising slope indicates fair weather and a decreasing slope indicates stormy weather.
